  abstract={Information on the action schemes used by undergraduate students involving chemical balance tasks at different levels of cognition (ALG, LOCS and HOCS) were investigated. The transcripts from the audiovisual record were submitted to Discursive Textual Analysis based on the Theory of Conceptual Fields. Action schemes in the molecular structural field involving chemical equilibrium are characterized by the instrumental use of concepts pertinent to the scientifically accepted explanatory model in conjunction with concepts that communicate with alternative conceptions already reported in the literature. In addition, there are significant differences in the use of concepts and operational invariants when moving from low-order cognitive tasks to high-order tasks for this same field of concepts.},
