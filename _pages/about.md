Hi, I'm Edson Cassius. I love technology, games and sports!

I analyze data and build dynamic dashboards to find insights that information is able to provide. I try to find answers to questions that can't be easily seen without a deeper analysis of data.

As a machine learning enthusiast, I like to build prediction models using the most recent technologies to promote data-driven decisions and find even more answers and insights.

Passionate with gaming and data, I try to connect both worlds and build programs to connect APIs and databases for transforming and visualizing data.
