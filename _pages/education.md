Passionate for technology and signal processing, I graduated in Information Engineering in 2018 in the Universidade Federal do ABC (UFABC) in Santo Andre, Sao Paulo - Brazil. UFABC is an accredited institution of higher learning in Brazil and with a very competitive recruitment process. GPA: 2.9 (above the average of 2.0 for the whole institution). <a href='https://github.com/edsoncassius/edsoncassius.github.io/blob/master/assets/pdf/morningside_eval.pdf'>(1)</a>

My final project was a fall detector system for elders and patients, capturing and analyzing data, and sending notifications through the Google Cloud API. <a href='https://graduacao.ufabc.edu.br/informacao/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2017_3_edson_lopes.pdf'>(2)</a>

As a bachelor student, I was able to maintain high enough grades to receive a scholarship for a Scientific Research Program for FAPESP in Chemistry Learning in 2012. Gathering, organizing and transcripting data where one of the actitivies involved to do the research project. 

My good performance also rewarded me with a full scholarship from the Science Without Borders Program back in 2013. For a year I was able to study Software Information Engineering in the Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest - Hungary, as an exchange student.

After coming to the U.S. in 2019, I began improving my English and also studying business in the Approach International Student Center for personal and professional development.

I intend to get a Master's Degree in the Data Science field or an MBA in the near future.
