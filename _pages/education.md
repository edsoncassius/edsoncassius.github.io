Passionate for technology and signal processing, I graduated in Information Engineering in 2018 in the Universidade Federal do ABC (UFABC) in Santo Andre, Sao Paulo - Brazil. UFABC is an accredited institution of higher learning in Brazil and with a very competitive recruitment process. UFABC is the only federal university in Brazil with 100% of professors with a doctoral degree.

To be able to get a Bachelor's in Information Engineering (2018) I had also to graduate as a Bachelor of Science and Technology (2016).

The Information Engineering course is divided into three main fields: Multimedia Processing, Networks and Telecommunication, encompassing the whole spectrum of transmission and analysis of information.

I graduated with a GPA of 2.9, without ever failing a single course. The grading system is different than U.S. universities and some courses are extremely hard to get a good grade, students of UFABC have an average of 2.0 GPA. Course is certified by Morningside Evaluations as the equivalent of a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from an accredited institution of higher education in the United States. <a href='https://github.com/edsoncassius/edsoncassius.github.io/blob/master/assets/pdf/morningside_eval.pdf'>(1)</a>

My final project was a fall detector system for elders and patients, capturing and analyzing data, and sending notifications through the Google Cloud API. <a href='https://graduacao.ufabc.edu.br/informacao/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2017_3_edson_lopes.pdf'>(2)</a>

As a bachelor student, I was able to maintain high enough grades to receive a scholarship for a Scientific Research Program for FAPESP in Chemistry Learning in 2012. Gathering, organizing and transcripting data where one of the actitivies involved to do the research project.

My good performance also rewarded me with a full scholarship from the Science Without Borders Program (Ciência Sem Fronteiras) back in 2014. For a year I was able to study Software Information Engineering in the Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest - Hungary, as an exchange student.

Among the courses taken included Programming, Functional and Object-Oriented Programming, Databases.

After coming to the U.S. in 2019, I began improving my English and also studying business in the Approach International Student Center for personal and professional development.

I intend to get a Master's Degree in the Data Science field or an MBA in the near future.
