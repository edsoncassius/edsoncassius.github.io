My educational and research background helped me to get an Intern job in 2017 as a Data Scientist in the Albert Einstein Israelite Hospital, in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The hospital is recognized as one of the best hospitals in Brazil and the selection process had multiple highly evaluated candidates. Within a year, I was soon hired as a Jr. Data Scientist and later promoted to Data Scientist.  

In the hospital I had the opportunity to develop my programming skills to build a Data Lake and a Hadoop Environment working from professionals from different fields. I also implemented many machine learning projects for forecasting, categorization and predicting outcomes.
