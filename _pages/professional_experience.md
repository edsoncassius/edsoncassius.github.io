It didn't take long for my interest in analyzing data to kick in. It all started when had the opportunity to study programming and build my first program, a data collector while doing a summer intern for 4D Soft in 2014.

My history and background helped me to get an Intern job in 2017 as a Data Scientist in the Albert Einstein Israelite Hospital, in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Within a year, I was soon hired as a Jr. Data Scientist and later promoted to Data Scientist. The hospital is recognized as one of the best hospitals in Brazil and the selection process had multiple highly evaluated candidates. 

In the hospital I had the opportunity to develop my programming skills to build a Data Lake and a Hadoop Environment working from professionals from different fields. I also implemented many machine learning projects for forecasting, categorization and predictions.

I'm currently working for Spring Air International where my skills were I was able to promote data-driven practices and create processes for assisting the sales and financial departments.
